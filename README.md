# Instagram-User-Analysis

User analysis is the process by which we track how users engage and interact with the digital product in an attempt to derive business insights for marketing, product & development teams.

These insights are then used by teams across the business to launch a new marketing campaign, decide on features to build for an app, track the success of the app by measuring user engagement and improve the experience altogether while helping the business grow. 

A) Marketing: The marketing team wants to launch some campaigns, and they need help with the following:

  1. **Rewarding Most Loyal Users**: People who have been using the platform for the longest time. Find the 5 oldest users of the instagram from the database provided.

  2. **Remind Inactive Users to Start Posting**: By sending them promotional emails to post their 1st photo. Find the users who have never posted a single photo on               Instagram.

  3. **Declaring Contest Winner**: The team started a contest and the user who gets the most likes on a single photo will win the contest. Now they wish to declare the           winner. Identify the winner of the contest & provide their details to the team.

  4. **Hashtag Researching**: A partner brand wants to know, which hashtags to use in the post to reach most people on the platform. Identify & suggest the top 5 most            commmonly used hashtags on the platform.

  5. **Lauch AD Campaign**: The team wants to know, which day would be the best day to launch ADs. What day of the week do most users register on? Provide insights on when       to schedule & campaign.

B) Investor metrics: Investors want to know if Instagram is performing well and is not becoming redundant like Facebook, they want to assess the app on the following grounds

  1. **User Engagement**: Are users still as active and post on Instagram or they are making fewer posts. Provide how many times does an average user posts on Instagram.         Also provide the total numbers of photos on Instagram and total number of users.
  2. **Bots & Fake Accounts**: The investors want to know if the platform is crowded with fake and dummy accounts. Provide data on users (bots) who have liked every single       photo on the site (since any normal user would'nt be able to do this.
