# Instagram-User-Analysis

User analysis is the process by which we track how users engage and interact with the digital product in an attempt to derive business insights for marketing, product & development teams.

These insights are then used by teams across the business to launch a new marketing campaign, decide on features to build for an app, track the success of the app by measuring user engagement and improve the experience altogether while helping the business grow. 

A) Marketing: The marketing team wants to launch some campaigns, and they need help with the following:

  1. **Rewarding Most Loyal Users**: People who have been using the platform for the longest time.
  (Find the 5 oldest users of the instagram from the database provided)
